This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command or during the build process with EAS Build. It doesn't point to a specific code error but rather a problem within the build environment or the project's configuration.  The exact cause can vary widely. Some common reasons are:

* **Missing or Incorrect Dependencies:**  Ensure all your project's dependencies (including native modules) are correctly installed and specified in your `package.json`.  A missing native module or an incompatibility between versions can trigger this.
* **Incorrect Android/iOS Configuration:** Problems in your `android/` or `ios/` folders (e.g., misconfigured build.gradle, Podfile, or plist files) can lead to this error. Review these files for any issues. 
* **Expo Go Issues:** If you're testing on Expo Go, make sure it's updated to the latest version and that the app is compatible. 
* **EAS Build Issues:** If using EAS Build, the error might be related to a build server problem or configuration discrepancies. Check the EAS Build logs for more specifics.
* **Platform-Specific Issues:** The error might be related to a problem only on one platform (Android or iOS).  Investigate the respective logs to pinpoint the problem.
* **Corrupted Project:** In rare cases, the project itself might be corrupted. Try creating a new Expo project and progressively moving over your code to find out whether the project is the cause.
