# Expo CLI Build Error: Uncommon Issues During `expo prebuild` or EAS Build

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error encountered when using Expo's build system (`expo prebuild` or EAS Build). This isn't a single code bug but rather a category of build failures originating from various sources. The provided example illustrates how to diagnose and troubleshoot these problems.

## Problem

The error message lacks specificity, making debugging challenging. It typically arises during the build process and does not indicate the root cause directly.  Possible causes include incorrect dependency management, misconfigurations in native Android or iOS settings,  Expo Go compatibility problems, or problems within EAS Build itself.

## Solution

The solution involves systematic debugging:

1. **Verify Dependencies:**  Ensure all dependencies (especially native modules) are correctly installed and version compatible.
2. **Check Android/iOS Configuration:** Examine your `android/` and `ios/` directories for any errors in `build.gradle`, `Podfile`, or plist files. 
3. **Update Expo Go:** If using Expo Go for testing, verify you have the latest version.
4. **Review EAS Build Logs:** If using EAS Build, carefully analyze the logs for detailed error messages.
5. **Platform-Specific Debugging:** Check if the error is Android or iOS-specific; focus on the relevant platform's logs.
6. **Create a New Project:** In rare instances, the Expo project itself might be corrupted. Try creating a fresh project to rule out this possibility.
